We will attempt to use public sentiment gathered via twitter to predict or explain market movements of specific stocks listed on public exchanges. Our project seeks to leverage open source data to generate alternative metrics which would then allow the savvy investor to capture alpha on their investments. 

Customarily, investors have relied upon discounted cash flow analysis, key metrics and multiples, or recent public actions to decide which stocks to buy or sell. While I have neglected to touch on all of the catalysts behind a trade such as a system of technical analysis, the most pertinent data to a stock's price fluctuations will be private information, released to the market via formal channels. 

However, modern technology has given us many more tools to evaluate a companyâ€™s performance over a quarter or even a day, and the proliferation of user-friendly APIs specifically in Python has granted the modern investor the ability to extract data in real time and then determine whether their new metric is useful when evaluating the purchase or sale of a stock. 
 
For our research project, we seek to determine whether Twitter sentiment regarding the six largest airlines by market cap (traded on U.S. exchanges) is predictive of their subsequent excess returns or losses.
